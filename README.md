GameLoop
========

GameLoop is not a game framework with everything you need to create awesome and fancy games with particles and physics and all that stuff.
GameLoop is just the bare-minimun helpers that **I** need to build a game in Canvas. GameLoop is currently under development at slow pace and just for fun.

In development / TODO:

- Complete Primitives module to include lines.
- Complete TileMap module with different layers, interaction matrix, an improved drawing method and objects. 
- Sprite module to be able to draw animated sprites.
- Interaction Module to manage keyboard and mouse events.
- More stuff to come...

Warning! Disclaimer: This is just a sandbox to learn javascript and try to get a game from scratch.
I love game programming so I think this is the best motivation for me to write 
"hobbie code" and learn. Don't take anything here as "good code", this is just
a learning excercise an thus I will be changing it frequently and (hopefully) 
trying wierd things.
