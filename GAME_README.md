This is a tiny osmos-like game using Primitive and Interaction modules. 

You can eat the Green primitives and be carefull of the red ones. The goal is to eat every primitive on screen.

- Controls: cursors to move, that's it, easy.

## TODO

- Interaction should go in a diferent module, this has to be done in master and then merged.
- Would be nice if the main character appear in the center of the screen.
- Game States for game over and Levels to have a more acomplished game.
